## 5.3.2
### Desktop (Windows)
Bumps the dependency `win32` to 5.0.2 ([#1281](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/pull/1281)). Thank you @frg2089!

## 5.2.11
### Desktop (Windows)
Updates dependencies, including win32 bump to 4.1.3 ([#1255](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/1255)).

## 5.2.10
### Desktop (Windows)
Fixes the bug that the result of the save-file dialog was incorrect when it was invoked with a long default file name but the user selected a file with a much short file name ([#1257](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/1257)).

## 5.2.9
#### General
Fixes the errors `Type 'Uint8List' not found` and `'Uint8List' isn't a type` ([#1260](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/1260)). Thank you @miguelslemos!

## 5.2.8

### Desktop (Windows)
Fixes the bug that the current directory sometimes changed after the user picked a file. Now, after the dialog is closed, the current directory is automatically restored to its original value even if the user changed the directory while searching for files ([#1254](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/1254)). Thank you @Tokenyet!

### Desktop (Linux)
Fixes the behavior of the `saveFile()` dialog on Ubuntu/Kubuntu. This fix should have been committed in the previous version _5.2.7_ but was forgotten. Now, when the user selects an already existing file, then Ubuntu prompts the user to confirm overwriting this file. This change finally makes the dialog behave the same on all desktop platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows) ([#989](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/989)).

## 5.2.7
### Desktop (Windows)
Fixes the behavior of the `saveFile()` dialog on Windows. Now, when the user selects an already existing file, then Windows prompts the user to confirm overwriting this file. This change makes the dialog behave the same on all desktop platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows). Previously, Windows would not have asked the user for confirmation ([#989](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/989)).

## 5.2.6

## 5.2.0+1
- Reverts 5.2.0 due to multiple regressions.


## 5.2.0

Update lints from 1.0.1 to 2.0.0 (with several fixes of code).

## 4.6.1

#### iOS
Handle `UTTypeCreatePreferredIdentifierForTag` returning `NULL`. This prevents a crash observed
on the iOS simulator on Apple Silicon ([#1040](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/783)).

## 4.6.0

#### iOS
Add conditional compilation of media, audio and document pickers for iOS.
This prevents error messages for permissions (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, NSAppleMusicUsageDescription, etc.) when publishing to app store connect, in case you don't need either category. This addresses [#783](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/783) in a different way.

## 4.5.1

#### Web
Adds `display:none` to the internal input element to fix a display issue in specific scenario's.

## 4.5.0

#### Desktop (Windows)
Changes the implementation of `getDirectoryPath()` on Windows to provide a modern dialog that looks the same as a file picker dialog ([#915](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/915)).

## 4.4.0

#### Desktop (Linux, macOS, and Windows)
Adds the additional parameter `initialDirectory` to configure the initial directory where the dialog should be opened. This parameter is supported for all three dialogs (pick files, pick directory, and save file). The only exception is that the parameter does not work on Windows for the function `getDirectoryPath()`. Please note that this feature has not been implemented for Android and iOS.

## 4.3.3

#### Desktop (Linux)
Introduces two fixes for the KDE Plasma Linux implementation which uses `kdialog` to open the file picker dialogs. Firstly, the selection of multiple files is fixed so that file paths with blanks/spaces are handled correctly. Secondly, file type filters are implemented. Thank you @w1th0utnam3.

## 4.3.2

#### Desktop (Windows)
Fixes the issue under Windows that the save-file dialog did not open if the specified file name contained an illegal character. Windows prohibits the usage of [reserved characters in file names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions). Now the exception `IllegalCharacterInFileNameException` is thrown if the specified file name contains forbidden characters
([#926](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/926)).

## 4.3.1

#### Desktop (Linux)
Adds KDE Plasma's `kdialog` arguments, allowing `filepicker` to invoke `kdialog` for file system manipulation using shell scripts on distributions that use KDE Plasma as their Desktop Environment and don't ship `zenity` or `qarma`.

## 4.3.0

##### Desktop (Windows)
Adds the parameter `lockParentWindow` for Windows desktop. This parameter makes the file picker dialog behave like a modal window. That is, the file picker always stays in front of the Flutter window until it is closed. Thank you @vinicios-cervantes.

## 4.2.8

##### Desktop (Windows)
Fixes the issue under Windows that the user could not select more than about 256 files (depending on the length of the file paths) because the buffer size for storing the selected file paths was too small. ([#918](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/918)).


## 4.2.7

##### Desktop (macOS & Windows)
Fixes the issue under Windows that the user could select all file types even though a file type filter was enabled. This error existed because the user could select the entry `All Files (*.*)` in the file type filter dropdown. Also, fixes the bug under macOS that users could select files without file extension even when one of the pre-defined file type filters (audio, image, video, or media) was enabled. ([#871](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/871)).

## 4.2.6

##### Android
Fixes linting error during builds ([#851](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/851)).

## 4.2.5

##### Desktop (macOS)
Fixes the issue of picking filenames that contain a comma followed by a space ([#890](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/890)).

## 4.2.4

##### iOS
Improves error handling when device can't fetch files due to low storage space ([#885](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/885)).

## 4.2.3

##### iOS
Fixed an issue that was creating a crash when media in PHPickerViewController in iOs was tapped several times very fast, we check that _result is not empty to avoid the crash. No Github issue created.

## 4.2.2+1

##### Android
Reverts Android `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission removal.

## 4.2.2

##### Android
Removes `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>` permission from the platform implementation Manifest since may not be required for some applications and devs can manually add it to their own application if needed ([#864](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/864)).

## 4.2.1

##### Android
Fixes an issue where `onFileLoading` would be called while picking directories ([#863](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/863)).

## 4.2.0

Adds the `identifier` property to the `PlatformFile` which references the original file identifier for both iOS & Android ([#804](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/804)).

## 4.1.6
##### Desktop (macOS)
Fixes the issue that users could not pick `.app` files on macOS because FilePicker tried to determine the file size of `.app` files. On macOS, these special kind of files are actually Unix directories in a special format ([read more on StackExchange](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/112213)). Now, if a file is picked, which is actually a directory, then the file size will be zero. ([#856](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/856))

## 4.1.5
##### Web
- Fixes an issue that would prevent the call to return when both `withReadStream` and `allowMultiple` were set. ([#843](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/843)).
- Addresses an issue in the example app.

## 4.1.4
##### Android
Addresses an issue where multiple media files couldn't be picked in some 3rd party explorers ([#846](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/846)). Thank you @innim98.

## 4.1.3
##### iOS
Fixes an issue where Live Photos were being picked as `.pvt` packages (since iOS 15). From now on, if `allowCompression` is set to `true`, Live Photos will automatically be converted to static JPEG pictures. ([#835](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/835))

## 4.1.2
##### Desktop (Linux)
Fixes the issue that on Linux the file type filter `FileType.any` did not allow the selection of files without file extension. ([#836](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/836))

## 4.1.1
##### iOS
Fixes an issue that would result in picker being dismissed by pulling down the modal sheet without an event. ([#828](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/828))

##### Web
Addresses an issue when comparing files on Web would result in an error due to `path` not being accessible. ([#822](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/822))

## 4.1.0
Extends API by new function `saveFiles()` for opening a save-file dialog as requested in [#799](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/799). This feature is only supported on desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

## 4.0.3
Makes the `path` getter nullable to match with its property ([#823](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/823)).

## 4.0.2
##### Desktop (Windows)
Fixes custom extension filter. Thank you @jgoyvaerts.

## 4.0.1
##### General
Overrides equality and toString for `platform_file` and `file_picker_result` for better comparison different results. Thank you @Nolence.
##### iOS
- Changes the presentation type of the picker from `UIModalPresentationCurrentContext` to `UIModalPresentationAutomatic` ([#813](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/813)).

##### Web
- Fixes regression of [#746](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/746).
- Updates exception text when trying to access `path` on Web. Thank you @maxzod.

## 4.0.0
### Desktop support added for all platforms (MacOS, Linux & Windows) ([#271](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/271)) 🎉
From now on, you'll be able to use file_picker with all your platforms, a big thanks to @philenius, which made this possible and allowed the [flutter_file_picker_desktop](https://github.com/philenius/flutter_file_picker_desktop) to be merged with this one.

Have in mind that because of platforms differences, that the following API methods aren't available to use on Desktop:
- The `onFileLoading()` isn't necessary, hence, `FilePickerStatus` won't change, since it hasn't any effect on those;
- `clearTemporaryFiles()` isn't necessary since those files aren't created — the platforms will always use a reference to the original file;
- There is a new optional parameter `dialogTitle` which can be used to set the title of the modal dialog when picking the files;

##### Web
Adds `onFileLoading()` to Web. ([#766](https://github.com/miguelpruivo/flutter_file_picker/issues/766)).

## 3.0.4
##### Android

iOS: Updates picker to use new PHPickerController for both single and multi media (image/video) picks (iOS 14 and above only).

## 2.0.0
**Breaking Changes**
- Unifies all platforms (IO, Web and Desktop) in a single plugin (file_picker) that can be used seamlessly across all. Both [file_picker_interface](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_platform_interface) and [file_picker_web](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_web) are no longer mantained from now on.
- You'll now have to use `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()` and extract the files from `FilePickerResult`;
- Because platforms are unified and mixing `File` instances from dart:io and dart:html required stubbing and bloated code, it's no longer available as helper method so you'll have to instanciate a `File` with the picked paths;

**New features**
- Simplified usage, now you only need to use `FilePicker.platform.pickFiles()` with desired parameters which will return a `FilePickerResult` with a `List<PlatformFile>` containing the picked data;
- Added classes `FilePickerResult` and `PlatformFile` classes with helper getters;
- On Android all picked files are scoped cached which should result in most of files being available. Caching process is only made once, so once done, the picked instance should be the same;
- On iOS picking audio now supports multiple and cloud picks;
- Added parameter `withData` that allows file data to be immediately available on memory as `Uint8List` (part of `PlatformFile` instance). This is particularly helpful on web or if you are going to upload to somehwere else;
- Major refactor with some clean-up and improvements;

**Removed**
- Single methods such as `getFilePath()`, `getMultiFilePath()`, `getFile()` and `getMultiFile()` are no longer availble in favor o `pickFiles()`;

## 1.13.3
Go: Updates MacOS directory picker to applescript (thank you @trister1997).

## 1.13.2
Android: fixes picking paths from Downloads directory on versions below Android Q.

## 1.13.1
Android: adds support to non-legacy picking on Android Q or above (thank you @lakshyab1995).

## 1.13.0+1
Fixes an issue that could prevent `1.13.0` from being built due to missing `allowCompression` property.

## 1.13.0
Adds `allowCompression` property that will define if media (video & image) files are allowed to be compressed by OS when picked. On Android this has no effect as it already returns the original file or an integral copy.

## 1.12.0
Adds `getDirectoryPath()` desktop (go) implementation.

## 1.11.0+3
Updates tearDown() call order on Android's implementation.

## 1.11.0+2
Updates README file (iOS preview).

## 1.11.0+1
Updates README file.

## 1.11.0
Adds `onFileLoading` handler for every picking method that will provide picking status: `FilePickerStatus.loading` and `FilePickerStatus.done` so you can, for example, display a custom loader.

## 1.10.0
Adds `getDirectoryPath()` method that allows you to select and pick directory paths. Android, requires SDK 21 or above for this to work, and iOS requires iOS 11 or above.

## 1.9.0+1
Adds a temporary workaround on Android where it can trigger `onRequestPermissionsResult` twice, related to Flutter issue [49365](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/49365) for anyone affected in Flutter versions below 1.14.6.

## 1.9.0
Adds `clearTemporaryFiles()` that allows you to explicitly remove cached files — on Android applies typically to those picked from remote providers, on iOS _all_ picked files are cached.

## 1.8.0+2
Updates podspec to use only PhotoGallery from DKImagePickerController (thanks @jamesdixon!)

## 1.8.0+1
Minor fix on `getFile()` method — should affect only those on 1.8.0.

## 1.8.0
Adds `FileType.media` that will allow you to pick video and images at the same time. On iOS, this will let you pick directly from Photos app (gallery), if you want to use Files app, you _must_ use `FileType.custom` with desired extensions.

## 1.7.1
Updates iOS multi gallery picker dependency and adds a modal loading while fetching exporting assets.

## 1.7.0
**Breaking change**

Added support for multi-picks of videos and photos from Photos app on iOS through [DKImagePicker](https://github.com/zhangao0086/DKImagePickerController) — use any of the `getMulti` methods with `FileType.image` or `FileType.video`. From now on, you'll need to add `use_frameworks!` in your ios/Podfile.

## 1.6.3+2

* Other minor improvements;

## 1.5.1

* iOS: Fixes an issue that could result in a crash when selecting files (with repeated taps) from 3rd party remote providers (Google Drive, Dropbox etc.);
* Go: Updates channel name;

## 1.5.0+1
Adds temporary workaround for (#49365)(https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/49365) until 1.14.6 lands on stable channel.

## 1.5.0

* **Breaking change:** Refactored `FileType` to match lower camelCase Dart guideline (eg. `FileType.ALL` now is `FileType.any`);

**Bug fix:** Fixes an issue that could prevent internal storage files from being properly picked.

## 1.4.0

**New features**
 * Adds Desktop support throught **[go-flutter](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter)**, you can see detailed instructions on how to get in runing [here](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover).
 * Adds Desktop example, to run it just do `hover init` and then `hover run` within the plugin's example folder (you must have go and hover installed, check the previous point).
 * Similar to `getFile`, now there is also a `getMultiFile` which behaves the same way, but returning a list of files instead.

**Improvements**
 * Updates Android SDK deprecated code.
 * Sometimes when a big file was being picked from a remote directory (GDrive for example), the UI could be blocked. Now this shouldn't happen anymore.

## 1.3.8

**Bug fix:** Fixes an issue that could cause a crash when picking files with very long names.

**Changes:** Updates Android target API to 29.

## 1.3.7

**Rollback - Breaking change:** Re-adds runtime verification for external storage read permission. Don't forget to add the permission to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as well. More info in the README file.

## 1.3.4+1

**Rollback:** Removes a local dependency that shouldn't have been committed with `1.3.4` which would cause Android build to fail.

## 1.3.4

## 1.3.2

**Bug fix:** Returns a `null` value in the `getFile()` when the picker is canceled.

## 1.3.1

**Bug fix:** Fixes an issue on Android, where other activity would try to call `FilePicker`'s result object when it shouldn't.

## 1.3.0

**Breaking changes**
 * `FileType.CAMERA` is no longer available, if you need it, you can use this package along with [image_picker](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker).

**New features**
 * You can now pick multiple files by using the `getMultiFilePath()` method which will return a `Map<String,String>` with all paths from selected files, where the key matches the file name and the value its path. Optionally, it also supports filtering by file extension, otherwise all files will be selectable. Nevertheless, you should keep using `getFilePath()` for single path picking.
 * You can now use `FileType.AUDIO` to pick audio files. In iOS this will let you select from your music library. Paths from DRM protected files won't be loaded (see README for more details).
 * Adds `getFile()` utility method that does the same of `getFilePath()` but returns a `File` object instead, for the returned path.

**Bug fixes and updates**
 * This package is no longer attached to the [image_picker](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker), and because of that, camera permission is also no longer required.
 * Fixes an issue where sometimes the _InputStream_ wasn't being properly closed. Also, its exception is now being forward to the plugin caller.
 * Fixes an issue where the picker, when canceled, wasn't calling the result callback on the underlying platforms.

## 1.2.0

**Breaking change**: Migrate from the deprecated original Android Support Library to AndroidX. This shouldn't result in any functional changes, but it requires any Android apps using this plugin to [also migrate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) if they're using the original support library.

## 1.1.1

* Updates README file.

## 1.1.0

**Breaking changes**

 * `FileType.CAPTURE` is now `FileType.CAMERA`

**New features**
 * Now it is possible to provide a custom file extension to filter file picking options by using `FileType.CUSTOM`
